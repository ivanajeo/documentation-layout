- **Classic Design**  
  Warm gray-beige background, clean typography, and timeless layout principles.

- **Fully Responsive**  
  On smaller screens, the navigation bar **moves to the top** and remains **scrollable** — ensuring a smooth experience across devices.

  No frameworks, no JavaScript. Just hand-coded structure and style — **lightweight and fast**.
